============================================
Open San Diego National Day of Civic Hacking
============================================

Open San Diego’s activity for NDoCH will be anchored around a day of presentations and hands-on participation for all levels of experience.  This is the fourth year of National Day. In years prior, government representatives have made appearances across the country. These have included everyone from top-ranking White House Officials, to Governors, Mayors and Fire Department Chiefs.  Our featured speaker this year will be *City Councilmember Todd Gloria*. We are also honored to have presentations from *Brian Genovese, Senior Engineer, Transportation and Storm Water, City of San Diego*; and  *the City’s Chief Data Officer Maksim Percheskiy*. Both Mr. Percheskiy  and the City’s Performance and Analytics Department, where he works, are the official Municipal Partners of the Open San Diego, Code for America Brigade.

Open San Diego’s National Day will be family-friendly, with engaging activity for programmers, parents and children, urbanists, designers, municipal staff, makers,, students and anyone else interested in presentations and hands-on activities focused on making the lives of San Diegans better.

A “Hack” is a fast solution to a problem.  It’s fast to conceive and it’s fast to execute. It may not be the perfect solution, but it’s a step we take that gets us to perfect, faster.  Here are the kinds of “hacks”  will be pursuing at the different event sites. All activity, including satellite events will take place between 10am and 4pm, although activity at some sites will end earlier than  4pm.

Spread over three four locations and three neighborhoods our hacks for the day will include  community asset mapping, coding lessons for youth, neighborhood prototyping, food trucks, community collaboration enabled by DIY radio Broadcasts and community organizing efforts

Open San Diego’s  community partners for the event are:
- Fab Lab San Diego,
